With many people isolating at home, these are troubling times indeed, and I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. I have been given an opportunity to work on something I have been wanting to do since the early 2000's; building my very own Xbox PC. While it won't have a Pentium 3 and GeForce 4 (I wish), it should be good enough to do some 1080p gaming and day to day tasks. 

Things it has so far:
GTX 1050 Ti, 8GB of ram, Wifi, Bluetooth, 2 front mounted USB 3.0 ports, 2 Xbox original controller ports (yes, FUNCTIONAL ports), a Wifi antenna on the rear, and (soon to come) an i5 4570. 

This thing is built literally from parts laying around the house, with the exception of the front USB ports and PCI-E extension cable. Somehow, I have managed to cram an atx PSU inside of it. More pictures to come.
